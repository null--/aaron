Find a way to go deep inside your target network to get the "Arkenstone".
Designed for hacktists, professional penetration testers and APT teams.

#About
  Imagine those hard times that you were inside an unknown network 
  trying to discover how things work by looking at anything, 
  just to find out a way to go deeper and deeper inside that jungle of 
  connected electronic devices.  Going deeper means you need
  to find new targets, but how? Yes! That cool netstat -an command, 
  shows valuable network information. But, did you ever try to 
  analyze 10000 lines of netstat result? THAT'S HELL OF A HARD WORK! 
  so you may use grep, awk, cut, sort, uniq and a bunch of | (pipes)
  trying to make one those magical single line commands and reduce 
  the netstat result to 1000 lines! That's geek but you need s
  omething more visual!

  Any advanced hacking or black-box penetration testing project starts
  with a short list of known targets. After exploiting one of those known
  targets, you should use all the information found inside that target 
  to find new targets. Discovering new HVTs is a key point for 
  a successful security breach because you can go deeper and deeper.

  aaron helps you do that in a more visual way!

#Why?
  - You can understand data-flow inside your target network.
  - You don't need to install it on remote target (e.g. libpcap)
      => less suspicious.
  - Find high value targets by looking at a graphical map!

#Features
  Core
    - Parse netstat results
    - Search!
    - Automated OS detection (based on netstat results)
    - Add/Edit/Remove Hosts/Connections
    - rdoc
    
  Graph
    - Draw network graph of your local machine
    - Draw a network graph based on results collected 
        from several remote hosts
    - Update an existing network graph
    - Export graphs in png and pdf formats
  
  Advanced Targeting
    - Add hosts to metasploit database
    - Supports SSH ans PSExec (SMB) protocols
    - Supports "adb shell" (android devices)  

#Installation:
  Ruby dependencies:
    1. thor
    2. net-ssh
    3. graphviz
    4. sqlite3
    5. activerecord
    6. highline
    7. termios
    
  General dependencies:
    1. metasploit: msfconsole
    2. android tools: adb
    
  Install on a Debian or kali Linux:
    $ sudo aptitude install ruby-thor ruby-net-ssh ruby-highline
    $ sudo aptitude install ruby-graphviz libsqlite3-ruby ruby-termios 
    $ sudo aptitude install ruby-activerecord android-tools-adb
    
    Note 1: 
    Make sure metasploit is installed and msfdb (postgresql on port 
    5432 and 5433) is up.
  
    Note 2:
    I think there shouldn't be any difficulties installing aaron on 
    other GNU/Linux, BSD or other Unix families, However there are
    some issues (like adb, psexec, etc.) installing aaron on a 
    windows machine but fixing those issues wouldn't be a 
    headache for a professional user.

  Third Party Tools:
    1. xdot to view .dot file
    2. sqlitebrowser to modify .axa file
    
#TODO
  - aaron search + regex
  - IPv6 netstat regex
